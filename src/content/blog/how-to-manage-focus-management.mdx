In JavaScript, the API for returning the element that has focus is `document.activeElement`.

```js
document.activeElement
```

To be specific,
`document.activeElement` returns the currently focused element _that is also_ confined to the current `document`.

This means,
if `document.activeElement` is some `<input>`,
and if we switch the window or tab,
then `document.activeElement` keeps being that `<input>`.

Element focus and document focus are independent of each other.

The API for returning whether the document has focus is `document.hasFocus()`.

```js
// true or false
document.hasFocus()
```

To be specific,
`document.hasFocus()` returns whether the document _can_ have focus,
and not whether any element in the document _is_ focused.

If nothing is focused in the document,
then `<body>` is focused.

```js
// nothing is focused
document.activeElement === document.body
```

- Yes, I realize that `<body>` is not _nothing_.
- Yes, I know that `<body>` is not inherently _focusable_.

:::notice
If this behavior seems odd, it’s because [`<body>` was a focusable element](https://twitter.com/jon_neal/status/1641265454931927041) at the time the API first appeared.
While that focusable behavior was later removed, browsers standardized its [API behavior](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=337631).

The API for watching focus changes to the document are the `window` events of `focus` and `blur`.

```js
window.addEventListener('focus', ({ target }) => {
	if (target !== window) return

	// document has gained focused
}, { capture: true })

window.addEventListener('blur', ({ target }) => {
	if (target !== window) return

	// document has lost focused
}, { capture: true })
```

:::notice
DOM events propagate _downward_ — from `window` to their `target` — _before_ bubbling upward.

This code uses `{ capture: true }` to observe the `focus` and `blur` events at their earliest opportunity.
:::

Our `focus` and `blur` listeners will also observe focus changes between elements.

Well, most elements.

If focus is moved inside the shadow root of a custom element,
then `document.activeElement` returns the custom element.

```html
<my-tab>
	#shadow-root
		<button>
			Pressable
		</button>
</my-tab>
```

In this example, if we focus the `<button>`,
then `document.activeElement` will return `<my-tab>`.

Using the `focus` and `blur` events, we can keep our own references

What if we focus an element in the ShadowDOM?


:::notice
All of this works the same in Firefox, with the caveat that `<html>` _is_ keyboard focusable.

This allows for some fun, albeit confusing logic.

For example,
you can use the keyboard tab to focus `<html>`,
and then click `<html>` via some empty area on the page,
and this will report that focus moved off of `<html>` and onto `<body>`.
